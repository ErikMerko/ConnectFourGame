# ConnectFourGame
A classic connect four game programmed in Java with a desktop Swing UI. 
I have used bit sequences to represent the board.  
For the virtual opponent I have implemented an optimized variant of the Negamax algorithm. 
In order to start the application run the Start file in the start package. 
All JAR files aka dependencies can be found in the libs folder.
